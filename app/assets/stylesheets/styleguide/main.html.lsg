# Carpe Living Style Guide - Main

Welcome to the Carpe style guide. This is the central location for all CSS and assets that power [Carpe](https://www.carpe.us/).

# Colors

@colors {
	$carpe-orange $carpe-grey $text-color
}


- Carpe Orange (`$carpe-orange`) is the Carpe brand color. Whenever possible the Carpe logotype should be in Carpe Orange.
- Carpe Grey (`$carpe-grey`) is a grey color commonly used on Carpe.
- Primary Text Color (`$text-color`) is the color used for most text on Carpe, and is used by default.


# Typography


## Pacifico
This is the font used for the Carpe logotype. It should not be used anywhere else.

@font-example 32px 'Pacifico', cursive {
	Carpe
}


The Carpe color and font are combined in the `.carpe-font` class.

```
<span class="carpe-font">Carpe</span>
@css {
	.carpe-font { font-size: 32px; }
}
```



## Open Sans
This is used for all text on Carpe that is not the logo and serves as the primary font for our site

@font-example 32px 'Open Sans', sans-serif {
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	01234567890!@#$%^&*()-_=+
}

# Alerts & Notices

Users often need to be notified that an action they attempted went through successfully or failed
for some reason. These are called notices and alerts, respectively, and are handled via Ruby on
Rails' [flash object](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html).

Here is an example notice:

<span class="notice">
	This is a positive notice - everything is working fine!
	<img src="/assets/close-wht.png" alt="Close wht">
</span>

This was shown by setting `flash[:notice] = "This is is positive notice...`

Here is an example alert:

<span class="alert">
	This is a negative notice - something went wrong!
	<img src="/assets/close-wht.png" alt="Close wht">
</span>

Similarly, this was shown by setting `flash[:alert] = "This is a negative notice...`

The application layout handles the logic and HTML for displaying alerts and notices.

# Links

For inline text, we can use the normal class to get a very basic link.

```
This is text with a <a href="#" class="normal">normal link</a> in it.
```

## Default Links

The default links are a set of buttons that are used across Carpe. They typically are not used
inline with text, but are used as part of the interface.

```
This is text with a <a href="#links" class="default"><span>default button</span></a> in it.
```

### Variants

There are several variants of default links that can be used with different intent.

Color variants are available for the buttons.

```
<a class="default red"><span>default button</span></a>
<a class="default green"><span>default button</span></a>
```

The `.default.can-load` button loads in a loading spinner and adds transitions to animate it in
and out. Adding the class `.loading` on a `.can-load` button will show the loading spinner,
animating it in and animating it out when the `.loading` class is removed.


```
<a class="default can-load"><span>loading button</span></a>
```
The button above toggles its loading state on click.

<script>
	$('.can-load').click(function(){
		$(this).toggleClass('loading');
	});
</script>


# Miscellaneous

## Simple Text Helpers

The classes `.no-bold`, `.center-text`, and `.small-text` can serve straight-forward uses in helping
to format text and handle common needs.

```
<h4>Normal Header</h4>
<h4 class="no-bold">No Bold Header</h4>
<h4 class="center-text">Centered Header</h4>
<span>Normal text</span>
<span class="small-text">Small text</span>
```

## Zero Top & Bot

The helper classes `.zero-top` and `.zero-bot` zero out margins and padding on the top and bottom
of an element. They were created primarily to help with using headers.



@css {
	.lsg-font-example-text::first-line { font-size: 1em; }
	.lsg-color-swatch {
		width: 150px;
		height: 150px;
		padding-top: 90px;
	}
}
