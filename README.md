# Carpe

A socially networked, intuitive calendar created in Ruby on Rails with a jQuery powered front end.

## Setup
Link to first-time setup can be found in the IndigoBox > Carpe Google Drive directory. 

## Running Locally
Run with foreman using `foreman start`

Which will run the local server at `localhost:5000`

Alternatively `rails s` can be used to the same effect, but the site will be visible at `localhost:3000`

## Deploying Changes

Make sure to push to origin and then heroku, like so:

``
git push origin master
`` and then
``
git push heroku master
``
